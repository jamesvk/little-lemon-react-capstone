                    Founded by chefs Mario and Adrian, Little Lemon
                    is the culmination of years spent refining their
                    craft in Michelin-starred restaurants across Europe.
                    The two met while working along the Mediterranean,
                    where they discovered a shared dream of opening a
                    restaurant that celebrated the region’s vibrant flavors
                    and rich culinary traditions. Bringing that vision
                    to Chicago, they created Little Lemon as a space where
                    fresh ingredients, modern technique, and genuine
                    hospitality come together.
